Chatter is an AJAX based chat box. It does not currently require registration,
but it supports listing logged in users, and avatars.
This code started as a quick hack, and has not progressed much beyond this. Expect serious ugliness or spaghetti code.

Requirements:
PHP 5
MySQL

You will find a MySQL Database schema in chatter.sql

You can see a live version at: http://wikicha.com/chat/
